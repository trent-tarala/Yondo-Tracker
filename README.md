## üíª Installation

1. Download this project to your computer:
   - Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
   - Select "Download ZIP"
   - Once downloaded, extract/unzip the folder to anywhere on your computer

2. Open the project:
   - Go to the folder you just extracted
       - Find and double-click the `home.html` file (it will open to the dashboard)
   - The app will open in your default web browser

That's it! The app runs entirely in your browser and saves all data locally on your computer.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è How to Update to a New Version

Your project data is saved on your computer, which is great! But it means you need to be careful when updating to a new version of the tracker so you don't lose your progress.

Follow these steps to update safely:

1.  **Download and Prepare the New Version**
    *   Download the new `.zip` file for the latest version.
    *   Extract the ZIP file:
        * Windows: Right-click the file and select "Extract All..."
        * Mac: Double-click the file to automatically extract it
        * This will create a folder named `yondo-tracker-main`.
    *   **Important:** When you open this folder, you will likely see *another folder* with the same name inside. This inner folder is the one with the actual application code. **Move this inner folder** into the same directory folder where you want to keep the application. Once it has been removed, there will be two folders with identical names in the same directory. One has the code, the other is completely empty at this point. Delete the empty one. 

2.  **Get Your Old Folder Ready**
    *   Go to where you have your current, working version of the tracker saved.
    *   **Rename your current folder.** For example, if your folder is named `yondo-tracker-main`, rename it to `yondo-tracker-old`. This keeps it as a backup.

3.  **Move the New Version Into Place**
    *   Now, find the new application folder you moved in Step 1.
    *   **Rename this new folder** to match the *original* name of your old folder. For example, if your old folder was `yondo-tracker-main`, name the new one `yondo-tracker-main`.
    *   Move this newly renamed folder to the same location where your old one was (e.g., into the `C:\Yondo\` folder from the example below).

Now, when you open `home.html` from the `C:\Yondo\Yondo-Tracker` folder, the new version of the app will load with all of your previous projects and data intact!

## üíæ Data Management (Import & Export)

Your data is saved in your browser, which is convenient but can be lost if you clear your browser's cache. To keep your data safe, you can use the built-in import and export tools.

*   **Export Data:**
    1.  On the dashboard, click the **"Export Data"** button.
    2.  This will save a single file named `yondo-tracker-backup.json` to your computer's "Downloads" folder.
    3.  This file contains all of your projects. Save this file in a safe place!

*   **Import Data:**
    1.  On the dashboard, click the **"Import Data"** button.
    2.  Select the `yondo-tracker-backup.json` file you previously saved.
    3.  A confirmation box will appear. **Warning:** Importing a file will overwrite all existing projects in the tracker.
    4.  If you confirm, all projects from the file will be loaded into the application.

This is the best way to back up your work, move it between different computers, or recover it if your browser data is ever cleared.

## üìñ How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Click "New Project" on the dashboard
3. Enter a name for your project (example: "January 2024 Break")
4. Click "Create"

### Tracking Packs
1. When a pack is pulled, click its number in the grid
2. Select the type of pack:
   - **Chaser**: For Chaser packs (1-8)

4. The probabilities will automatically update
5. The Teams Pulled section will update if you selected a team
6. Your personal pulls will appear in the "Packs You Pulled" table

### Reading Probabilities
The probability panel shows your chances for each type of pack:
- These numbers are calculated based on what's left
- Example: If "Chaser: 25%" appears, you have a 25% chance of pulling a chaser with your next pack

The probability deviation chart helps track probability changes:
- Use the toggles to switch between Chasers, Teams, and Floors
- The grey line shows the starting probability (baseline)
- The solid line shows how probabilities change as packs are opened
- The deviation indicator shows if you're above/below baseline:
  - Yellow means you're close to baseline (within ¬±5%)
  - Green means probabilities are better than baseline (>5% above)
  - Red means probabilities are worse than baseline (>5% below)
- Hover over the line to see exact probabilities at any point

### Teams Section
- All 32 NFL teams are displayed
- Unpulled teams appear in gray
- Pulled teams show in their team colors
- Teams are alphabetically ordered for easy reference

### Packs You Pulled Section

- Empty state shows "You haven't picked anything yet"

### Project Controls
- **Mark Complete**: Click when you're done to save the final state. This prevents accidental changes when reviewing historical data.

- **Team Colors**: Each NFL team shows in its official color when pulled
- **Quick Reference**: Hover over any team-marked pack to see which team it was
- **Project Organization**: Create separate projects for each different stream
- **Completion**: Use "Mark Complete" when done to prevent accidental changes

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I undo a mistake?**  
A: Yes! Just click the pack again and select the correct option.

**Q: Will I lose my progress if I close the browser?**  
A: No, everything saves automatically.

**Q: Can I edit a completed project?**  
A: No, completed projects are locked to prevent accidental changes.

**Q: How are probabilities calculated?**  
A: The app uses the remaining pack counts divided by total unopened packs to calculate percentages.

**Q: What does the baseline in the probability chart mean?**  
A: The baseline is your starting probability for each type (e.g., 13.33% for Chasers since 8/60 = 13.33%). It helps you see if your current odds are better or worse than what you started with.
